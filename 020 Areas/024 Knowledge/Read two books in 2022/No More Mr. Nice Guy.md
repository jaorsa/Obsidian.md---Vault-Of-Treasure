# Chapter 1 

# Chapter 2
Men learned how to be mean by watching their fathers or male family members, when families moved after world war 2, some boys never saw what their father did. 

Divorces tripled between 1940 to 1970, over one million household were administered by women. In general, nice guys do not report having a close bonding relationship with their fathers in childhood (being withdrawn and passive). 

The unavailability of their dads during their growing age often required women to do the job of the fathers. Women turned boys into men. 

# Chapter 3
Chapter 3 - Learn to please yourself  
  
"I am a chameleon, i will become whatever I believe whatever a person wants me to be in order to be liked"  
  
Underneath it all, I don't know who I am, if I can't figure out what people want me to be, I'm afraid i will be alone. The funny thing is I feel alone most of the time anyway.  
  
Just about everything a nice guy does is consciously or unconsciously calculated to gain someone's approval or to avoid disapproval. Nice Guys seek this external validation in about relationship or social situation.  
  
Tod is an example of internal toxic shame, believes he has to become what other people wants him to be. By tying to please everyone, they end up pleasing no-one. Including themselves.  
  
--------------------------------  
  
**Seeking approval**  
Because nice guys do not believe they are ok just as they are, they may focus on something about themselves (something they do, dance nice, work hard) or even something external to themselves (nice car, cute kids) in order to win other's approval.  
  
Nice guys attach their identity and worthÂ  to those things and use them to convince others they are valuable. Nice guys don't know what else about themselves make them lovable. Being a nice guy is the ultimate attachment to them thinking that they are good compensate. They believe they're bad.  
  
They can't grasp that people may love them just as they are, they believe they are bad and therefore they assume that if anyone would really get to know them, they would discover the same thing.  
  
"If they hope to be love, get their needs met they need to have value", is one of their core beliefs.  
  
**Breaking free activity #3**  
  
_Note any of the ways you seek approval, add to the list any behaviours and write down examples of each, ask others for feedback about the ways they see you seeking approval._  
  

1.  Being smart
2.  Having a pleasant none threatening voice
3.  Appearing unselfish
4.  Making other people happy
5.  Appearing to be good
6.  Being submissive
7.  Not giving troubleÂ 
8.  Disappearing to avoid conflictÂ 

  
Example: *Kal likes to dress his daughter to the park, from the moment he starts dressing her, he unconsciously attach his value to her. The irony is that no one really values kal for his attachments, his dependency.*
